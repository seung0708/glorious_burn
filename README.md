Sinatra Project

This project is based on a workout tracker. The idea of the application is that a user is able to log their workouts and add workouts to the database so that they can log those workouts too. 

The user will be able to login and as soon as they login, they will see all of the workouts that they tracked showing the dates, workout name, number of sets, and number of reps. 

The user should be able to edit the workouts if they make a mistake and should only be able to see their workouts, not other users. 

There are a lot of standard workouts out there, but there are workouts that are personally/professionaly developed. These kinds of workouts make it hard to find. 

For these kinds of workouts, the user will be able to add them and include them into their workoutlog. The user can add the workoutname, a short description of the workout, and an image if available.
